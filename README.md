## Prerequisits
TinTin++ and terminator have to be installed.

* seperate input line on bottom of the main game screen
* display stats like HP, thirst, hunger, hornieness,.... color coded in the first line of the main game window
* display currently available jobs in the second line of the game window

Add the hellmoo layout to your terminator layout config.
