# HellMOO tintin++ scripts
This repository contains my **TinTin++** configuration for **HellMOO**.

This script collection assumes that you want to use *TinTin++* in combination with *terminator*.

The top *terminator* pane displays the main game window and the bottom pane the corp chat.

## Features
* seperate input line
* display stats like HP, thirst, hunger, hornieness,.... in the first line
* display currently available jobs in the second line
* redirect corp chat to a seperate file and display it in a seperate *terminator* pane

## Prerequisits
*TinTin++* and *terminator* have to be installed. And of course you also need credentials for *HellMOO*.

## Configuration
Just set your **username**, **password** and **corp** in *preferences.tin*

## Run
just run *hellmoo.sh*

    ./hellmoo.sh
